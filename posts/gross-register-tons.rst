Read some interesting things (once again) about `Docker <http://www.docker.io/>`_ yesterday:

`Why Docker? Why Not Chef? <http://blog.relateiq.com/why-docker-why-not-chef/>`_ - Very interesting read.

`Cocaine <http://api.yandex.com/cocaine/>`_ - PasS from yandex.ru, build around docker. (`techcrunch <http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/16/search-engine-giant-yandex-launches-cocaine-a-cloud-service-to-compete-with-google-app-engine/>`_)

Plus many more the last months... 

Docker is the reason, I've started developing again on my local machine, ditching aws micro-instances when possible. It makes vagrant *(read vmware or virtualbox)* looking old, at least from a developers perspective. Minimal footprint, fast; but nevertheless totally encapsulated - great! 

For example: I had to try out things with ElasticSearch yesterday. I've installed a running container within minutes with one command and evaluated the things I had to. Easy going.

*Disclaimer: Developers using Mac won't problably get this, but that's not my problem :)*
