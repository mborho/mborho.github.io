A great new `Docker <http://docker.io>`_ version was released these 
days: `0.6.5 
<http://blog.docker.io/2013/10/docker-0-6-5-links-container-naming-advanced-port-redirects-host-integration/>`_.

Now it's possible to give your containers persistent names and also to 
link them among themselves. Big win!

After all I can't remember the reason for using fat virtual machines ...
